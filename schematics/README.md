## This is my personal concept of a small add-on board with a FPGA connected to the Beagleboard-X15 "the beast" with following features : 

	Xilinx XC3S500E Spartan 3E FPGA
	Micron M25P40 4Mb SPI Flash configuration memory
	256Mb Synchronous High-Speed CMOS DRAM MT48LC16M16A2P-7E, 16Mb x 16Bit x 4 Banks
	ATmega328 8-bit AVR Microcontroller
	ADC TI-ADS5522 12 bits / 80 Mhz with SMA conn. input
	DAC Analog Devices AD9764 TxDAC 14 bits / 125 Mhz with SMA conn. output
	50 MHz crystal oscillator and 125 Mhz crystal oscillator
	Linear Tech LTC6904 I2C 10kHz-68MHz programmable CMOS clock oscillator
	I2C EEPROM
	3.3V I2C port for off-board serial expansion.
	JTAG port for FPGA development and debugging
	Diagnostic LEDs (2 User defined, 2 Configuration status)
